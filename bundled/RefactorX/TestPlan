Test Plan for Refactor-X 2.0

Licensing
---------
If unlicensed, a pretty panel asks you for a license on application startup
If you have a temporary license that is going to expire, you are told this.
There should be some way of entering a new license even if you already have a valid license
This pretty panel points you to the Six and Red River site, if you wish to purchase a license
The pretty panel never shows up again, nor does anything else once you have entered a valid license
If you enter an invalid license, you are warned, and told why it is invalid, before being asked to reenter
When you do enter a valid license, you are thanked.
You can cancel out of the license process (although then you'll be asked again on startup).
If you don't have a license, no Refactor-X functionality is enabled.
