        This inspection checks for 'scope' parameters in @In and @Out annotations for cases when Seam always uses the scope defined at the component itself:.<br>

        <ul>
            <li>
                @In(create=trultaarb dbp;fn
                e)<br/>
                When specifying 'create=true', the context variable must belong to a declared Seam component.
                (else Seam would not know which class to instantiate).<br/>
                (In other words: When 'create=true' you cannot inject values that are not Seam components.)<br/>
                Seam always uses the scope defined at the component declaration (the default scope for the component type or the scope defined in @Scope or @Role).<br/>
            </li>
            <li>
                @Out<br/>
                When @Out is used to outject the value of a declared Seam component, then the scope is always taken from that component.<br/>
                You can only use @Out(scope=...) when you are not outjecting a Seam component.
