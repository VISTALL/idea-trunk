        Currently the only thing you can change here is the framework instance used in the current project. The
        <span class="ijControl">Framework Instance</span> comboBox contains the names of all framework instances defined for the
        currently running <span class="intelliJIDEA">IntelliJ IDEA</span>. Choose one of them or change to <a href="frameworkdefinitions.html">Framework Definitions</a>
        if the one you need is not yet defined.
      </p>
      <div class="ijNote">
      <img alt="Tip" src="images/note.gif">&nbsp;&nbsp;The entries shown in the comboBox are the names of the framework
        instances followed by the name of the used framework integrator in parentheses. In the case that you are opening
        a project created with another installation of <span class="intelliJIDEA">IntelliJ IDEA</span> that does not yet
        have the framework instance used by the project, <q>undefined</q> will be shown where normally the name of the
        framework integrator appears. If that is the case, change to <a href="frameworkdefinitions.html">Framework Definitions</a>
        and define the framework instance.
