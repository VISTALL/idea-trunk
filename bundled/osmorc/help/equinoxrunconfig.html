    <p>
      The <strong>Eclipse Equinox</strong> run configurations allows running of Eclipse Equinox applications and products.
    </p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>
        The first thing to decide in this kind of run configuration is which application or product will be started.
        If there is an application <strong>myApplication</strong> defined in the <strong>plugin.xml</strong> of a bundle
        with the symbolic name <strong>com.mycompany</strong>, you would type in <strong>com.mycompany.myApplication</strong>
        as the application name. It works the same way for Equinox products.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can also specify whether the Equinox console shall be activated and whether extra debug output shall be printed
        on the console. The debug output will - when activated - also contain the log output when starting of an application
        or product fails, which normally contains details about why it failed.
