  <div class="introduction">

    <p>
      The <strong>Felix framework integrator</strong> provides integration for Apache Felix.
    </p>
  </div>


  <div id="content">
    <div class="section">
      <h1>The Base Directory</h1>

      <p>
        As there is no downloadable package containing both sources and binary bundles, here a description of what the
        integrator expects to find follows.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the time of this writing the current version of Apache Felix is 1.0.3. The downloadable binary ZIP or tar
        contains the folder <strong>felix-1.0.3</strong>. Unpack this folder somewhere and specify it as the base folder
        for the
        integrator. The integrator loads the bundle jars from the <strong>bin</strong> and <strong>bundle</strong> folders.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you'd like to access the sources of the bundles in IDEA, create a folder named
        <strong>src</strong> below
        the base folder and here two folders <strong>bin</strong> and <strong>bundle</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Copy all source ZIPs for felix.jar into the <strong>src/bin</strong> folder. main-1.0.3.zip and framework-1.0.3.zip should be put
        here. Unfortunately they don't contain the sources for all classes in felix.jar and you'll have to
        download other files like org.osgi.core-1.0.0.zip and put them here to get the sources for all classes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Put the source ZIPs for the other bundles into <strong>src/bundle</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Don't change the source ZIPs of any of the bundles. The integrator expects to find the Felix
        specific folder structure inside them. A source ZIP named mybundle-1.00.zip will contain the sources
        in the folder mybundle-1.00/src/main/java
