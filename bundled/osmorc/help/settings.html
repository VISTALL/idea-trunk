        <a href="projectsettings.html">Project Settings</a> is used to change settings specific for the current project like

    <div class="section">
      <h1>Facet Settings</h1>
      <p>
        In the facet settings you first have to decide whether you will edit the manifest files yourself or whether you
        want Osmorc to create it with bnd from the dependencies on other modules and libraries.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you decide to maintain the manifest file manually, Osmorc creates dependencies on modules and the framework instance
        bundles in the module where the manifest file is changed. Here you take charge of the OSGI dependencies between
        your bundles and Osmorc tries to match them with corresponding module dependencies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Letting Osmorc generate the manifest files for you is exactly the other way around. You develop your application
        as you would develop any other application in IDEA. You add dependencies on other modules and libraries and Osmorc
        tries to translate those dependencies into OSGI dependencies when running your bundles.
      </p>
      <p>If you are maintaining the manifest file yourself, you have to tell Osmorc where it is to be found. You can change
        this location for each module or you can define a project default in the project settings and use it here.</p>
      <p>Each time a module is compiled, Osmorc creates a bundle JAR for that module. This JAR is used when running
        an Osmorc run configuration. You can change how the JAR is named and where it is put, but for most cases the
        created default should be OK.</p>
      <p>The created JAR contains the compilation output and the manifest file - either the manually maintained or
        one created by Osmorc. Sometimes you will need to add some other files that need to be copied into the
        generated JAR. For Eclipse RCP bundles - or plugins as they are called there - you will need to add the plugin.xml.
        You can do this in the table listing additional JAR content. The first column takes the path to the source
        file relative to the content root of the module and the second column takes the path to the destination file.
        So since the plugin.xml of an Eclipse RCP plugin normally resides in the root of a plugin, you will type in
        <strong>plugin.xml</strong> for both columns of that entry. Future versions will provide a file chooser to
        choose the source file.</p>
      <p>Note that currently the table for the additional JAR contents is very simple. It grows automatically as you
        type in new file definitions. There is always an empty row at the bottom that waits for new content. If you
        want to remove an entry, simply remove both the source and destination definition for it. It is then
        automatically deleted.</p>
