  <div class="introduction">
    <p>Eclipse RCP and Eclipse Plugin projects are based on OSGI. At the core of an Eclipse application there is an
      OSGI runtime called <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/equinox-portal/">Equinox</a>. Osmorc's <a
            href="equinoxintegrator.html">Equinox framework integrator</a> provides support for working on applications
      using Equinox. At the time of this writing it is not possible to run and debug OSGI applications with Osmorc, but
      that is a planned feature for the near future. Currently Osmorc also doesn't contain any support for Eclipse
      specific
      features like extensions.</p>

    <p>Currently it is possible to import an Eclipse workspace into IDEA and use Osmorc to resolve dependencies between
      the different
      OSGI bundles of that workspace. The outcome is that the created IDEA project can be compiled in IDEA without any
      errors
      and the classes, manifest files and other artefacts of the bundles can be edited.</p>

    <p>Jetbrains provides a <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/documentation/usingIDEAforEclipse.html">guide</a>
      describing how to migrate Eclipse RCP applications to IDEA. This is a work around that enables the developer
      of an Eclipse RCP application to work on that application with a pure IDEA without Osmorc. Projects changed
      as described in that guide won't be compatible with Osmorc. Osmorc adds OSGI support to IDEA making a great part
      of the work around obsolete. Please use the following guide to import an Eclipse workspace into IDEA.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <div class="ijProcedureSteps">
        <div class="procHeader">Import an Eclipse workspace into IDEA</div>
        <ol>
          <li>
            IDEA contains support for importing Eclipse workspaces. Please follow the steps described in
            the help page <strong>Importing Eclipse Project to IntelliJ IDEA</strong> of the IDEA help system.
          </li>
          <li>
            Don't check the <strong>Link created IntelliJ IDEA modules to Eclipse project files</strong> option.
            Osmorc changes the dependencies between the modules created from the Eclipse projects in order to
            make them match the bundle dependencies expressed in the manifest files. Linking IDEA modules with
            Eclipse project files would result in unnecessary dependencies being introduced into the project files.
          </li>
          <li>
            Afterwards remove the dependency to the global library <strong>ECLIPSE</strong> on any of the created
            modules if one was added.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <div class="ijProcedureSteps">
        <div class="procHeader">Adding the Osmorc facet to all modules.</div>
        <ol>
          <li>
            After creating a project and modules for an Eclipse project, IDEA should detect the modules as being
            candidates
            for an Osmorc facet and display a message for each detection. Confirm adding of the Osmorc facet to each
            module.
            Osmorc only works on modules with its facet.
          </li>
          <li>
            Check that each module has an Osmorc facet. To do so open
            <nobr><span class="ijMenu">File | Settings | Project Settings | Project Settings</span></nobr>
            . Here select
            <strong>Modules</strong> and check that each module in the tree to the right has a subnode Osmorc.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you inadvertently deny the addition of the Osmorc facet, remove it or if it just does appear as a subnode
            of the module node, add it manually.by selecting the module, and then clicking on the + icon above the
            module
            tree and choosing Osmorc from the appearing menu.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>

      <p>
        Now you have imported your Eclipse workspace into IDEA, you can start working on it in IDEA. One thing
        you haven't  done yet, is transfer your target platform into IDEA. In Osmorc the target platform is called
        a framework instance and you can define it in Osmorc's settings. Please read the
        <a href="settings.html">Settings</a>-part of this documentation to learn how to define different framework
        instances and how to choose one for a project.
