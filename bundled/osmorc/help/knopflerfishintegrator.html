      <h1>The Base Directory</h1>

      <p>
        The base directory for Knopflerfish framework instances is the installation folder of Knopflerfish. There should
        be
        a folder named <strong>knopflerfish.org</strong> in that folder, which again should contain a folder named
        <strong>osgi</strong>. The integrator searches for bundles in a child folder <strong>jars</strong> and for the
        matching sources in <strong>bundles</strong>.
