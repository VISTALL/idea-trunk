        Different implementation of the OSGI specification are available. Each of them has a different set of
        base bundles, different ways to start them and a different folder layout containing the binary bundles and
        their sources.
      </p>

      <p>
        Osmorc uses the notion of <strong>framework integrators</strong> and <strong>framework instances</strong> to
        cope
        with this diversity.
      </p>

      <p>
        A framework integrator is used to integrate an instance of of a specific framework implementation. Osmorc
        contains framework integrators for <a href="equinoxintegrator.html">Eclipse Equinox</a>,
        <a href="knopflerfishintegrator.html">Knopflerfish</a> and <a href="felixintegrator.html">Apache Felix</a>. An
        extension point for framework integrators is also available. So integrators for framework implementations not
        directly supported by Osmorc can be developed by third parties.
      </p>

      <p>
        A framework instance is a concrete installation of a framework implementation. As framework instances are
        normally
        not installed in the folder structure of a project, a framework instance with a specific name can be installed
        in different locations under different installations of <span class="intelliJIDEA">IntelliJ IDEA</span>. A
        project
        only knows the name of the framework instance it uses. Osmorc creates the connection to the framework instance
        if
        it exists as soon as the project is opened.
