  <div class="introduction">
    <p>This guide describes how to set up a new project with Osmorc. Please take a look at
      <a href="importeclipseproject.html">Importing an Eclipse Workspace.</a> if you want to import an existing
      Eclipse workspace into IDEA.
    </p>

    <p>In this section we'll describe how to activate Osmorc for a module. Nothing about the creation of projects
      and modules which will use Osmorc is Osmorc-specific. So create them just like you would create any other
      IDEA projects and modules.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="content">
    <div class="section">
      <p>
        To actually activate Osmorc for a module the Osmorc facet needs to be added to the module. Adding the facet
        can be achieved via two different ways:
      </p>

      <div class="ijProcedureSteps">
        <div class="procHeader">Explicit addition of the Osmorc facet</div>
        <ol>
          <li>
            You can manually and explicitly add the Osmorc facet to a module. To do it open
            <nobr><span class="ijMenu">File | Settings | Project Settings | Project Settings</span></nobr>
          </li>
          <li>Choose modules</li>
          <li>Click on the module to which you want to add the facet</li>
          <li>Click on the +-icon above the modules tree and choose Osmorc</li>
          <li>Now the facet is added and a manifest file is created in the META-INF folder of the module if doesn't
            exist yet.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <div class="ijProcedureSteps">
        <div class="procHeader">Automatic detection of the facet.</div>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Create a folder named META-INF in the root folder of your module.
          </li>
          <li>
            Create a manifest file <strong>MANIFEST.MF</strong> inside this folder
          </li>
          <li>
            At at least the two headers <strong>Bundle-ManifestVersion</strong> and <strong>Bundle-SymbolicName</strong>
            into
            the manifest file.
          </li>
          <li>
            IDEA will now recognize the Osmorc facet for the module and will propose to add it. Confirm the addition.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>

      <p>Now you can start working on your OSGI application. Change your manifest files to export and import
        packages and Osmorc will create corresponding dependencies between the IDEA modules.</p>
      <p>You may also want to take a look at the <a href="settings.html" >Settings</a>-part of this documentation
        to learn how to define and use framework instances.</p>
